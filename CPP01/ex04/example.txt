Once upon a time in a small village, there was a black cat named Shadow.
Shadow loved to climb trees and chase butterfliesShadow. 
Every morning, Shadow would sit by the window, waiting for the sun to rise.
The villagers believed that seeing Shadow in the morning brought good luck.
Shadow's favorite place was the old library, where the dust danced in the light and silence told a thousand stories.
